    </p>

    <h3><i class="icon fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>Coverage Limitations:</h3>

    </ul>

    <h3><i class="icon fas fa-file-alt"></i>Warranty Claims:</h3>
    <p>
        To initiate a warranty claim, report any mechanical or electrical issues directly to Every Day Auto Sales. The vehicle must be taken to our authorized service center for diagnosis and repairs. All repair work under warranty must be performed by authorized technicians at our service center or approved service providers, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing. We reserve the right to inspect the vehicle before approving any warranty claims. Unauthorized repairs or modifications without prior written consent will void the warranty.

    <h3><i class="icon fas fa-gavel"></i>Limitation of Liability:</h3>
    <p>
        Our liability under this warranty is limited to the repair or replacement of defective parts, at our discretion. We are not liable for incidental, consequential, or indirect damages arising from the use or inability to use the vehicle.
    </p>

    <h3><i class="icon fas fa-exchange-alt"></i>Trial One-Week Return Conditions:</h3>

Damages or excessive mileage may result in fees or deductions from the original purchase price. To start the return process, contact our customer service within the trial period. We will guide you through the return process and provide further instructions.
    </p>
